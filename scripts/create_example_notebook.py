            # ResMatching Walkthrough for Biologists and Microscopists

            This notebook is a guided, beginner-friendly example of the full **ResMatching** workflow.
            It is designed for readers who may be new to Python but want to understand what the model is doing at each step.

            We will do four practical things:

            1. Look at the microscopy data and understand what the model sees.
            2. Run a **tiny training demo** for only 2 to 3 epochs, just to watch the loss change.
            3. Load a **pre-trained model** and run inference on a small number of validation and test images.
            4. Compute simple quality metrics, make a calibration plot, and visualize the input, ground truth, MMSE reconstruction, and posterior samples.

            This notebook is intentionally light.
            It is **not** meant to reproduce the full paper numbers.
            Instead, it is meant to make the workflow understandable and easy to adapt.

            ## Before You Start

            This example assumes that the repository dependencies are installed and that you have access to the BioSR data and the ResMatching checkpoints.

            A few important notes:

            - In this repository's actual training and inference code, **channel 1 is used as the observed noisy / low-resolution input**.
            - **Channel 0 is used as the clean / high-resolution target**.
            - That convention is what we follow in this notebook, even if some older comments in the code suggest the opposite.

            Throughout the notebook, we also include a few teaching figures from `notebooks/figures/`.
            These are there to give a visual explanation before readers look at the code.

            It:

            - finds the repository root automatically,
            - adds the repository to Python's import path,
            - defines all user-editable settings in one place,
            - chooses CPU or GPU,
            - and fixes random seeds so repeated runs are easier to compare.

            ## Where to Extend This Notebook

            This notebook was written to be understandable first and exhaustive second.

            Good next extensions would be:

            - increase `NUM_INFERENCE_IMAGES` and `NUM_POSTERIOR_SAMPLES`,
            - switch to another subset such as `mt` or `factin`,
            - insert your custom explanatory figures between the markdown sections,
            - compare the tiny checkpoint and the pre-trained checkpoint side by side,
            - and, for full paper-style evaluation, run the repository scripts on the complete dataset.

            If you want, this notebook can also be turned into a more polished teaching document with callout boxes, saved output figures, and a short glossary for microscopy users.
